Have a clean git repo
create a server setup
buy a domain as low as you can - search internet
Get the kubernates cluster ready - Make sure it can be created many times
SO you should use terraform
Put on the jenkins on the kubernates server 
Put on Jfrog , Quality gates as containers and try to hold the data if you can -  make it persistant
Get a three-tier or multi-tier arch application and make it communicate on kubernates
Implement this on AWS
Keep motivated, Keep automating, Keep learning


Your responsible to automate all the task , 
 - so Jenkins will do it step by step
 - Docker will package and ship the application as a container
 - Kubernates helps to make it stay active and auto scale
 - Terraform automates the infra to help above

Think in a way what you are automating and where the new concept is helping you in the automation.
Go step by step
